# SDG Chatbot Implementation Summary

## What We've Built

A comprehensive SDG (Sustainable Development Goals) chatbot similar to your health indicator chatbot, specifically designed for analyzing SDG data across Indian districts.

## Files Created

### Core Application Files
1. **`sdg_main.py`** - Main FastAPI application with OpenAI function calling
2. **`sdg_utils.py`** - Database utility functions for SDG data analysis  
3. **`config.py`** - Configuration management with environment variables
4. **`requirements.txt`** - Python dependencies

### Supporting Files
6. **`run_server.py`** - Startup script for the server
7. **`env.example`** - Environment variables template
8. **`README.md`** - Comprehensive documentation
9. **`IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`** - This summary document

## ðŸ”§ Key Features Implemented

### 1. First Function: SDG Goal Analysis
- **`get_indicators_by_sdg_goal()`** - Lists all indicators for an SDG goal
- **`get_sdg_goal_data()`** - Main analysis function with multiple query types:
  - `individual` - Specific district data
  - `top_performers` - Best performing districts  
  - `bottom_performers` - Worst performing districts
  - `trend` - Both top and bottom for comparison

### 2. Intelligent Query Processing
- Natural language understanding similar to your health chatbot
- Automatic intent detection (top/bottom/trend/individual)
- Smart parameter extraction (numbers, district names, etc.)

### 3. Conversation Management
- Context retention across queries
- Token management for OpenAI API efficiency
- Similar conversation flow as your original chatbot

### 4. Database Integration
- Works with your existing SDG database schema
- Supports the tables you created: `SDG_Goals`, `District_State`, `Aspirational_Status`, `SDG_Status`, `SDG_Goals_Data`
- Optional spatial data support with `District_Geometry`

## ðŸŽª Query Examples Supported

### Basic SDG Goal Inquiry
```
"What indicators are available for SDG Goal 1?"
"Show me all SDG 3 indicators"
```
**â†’ Uses:** `get_indicators_by_sdg_goal()`

### Performance Ranking  
```
"Show me the top 5 districts for SDG Goal 3"
"Best performing districts for SDG Goal 2"
"Worst districts for SDG Goal 1"
```
**â†’ Uses:** `get_sdg_goal_data()` with ranking

### Trend Analysis
```
"Compare top and bottom districts for SDG Goal 5"
"SDG Goal 2 trends"
"Show both best and worst performers"
```
**â†’ Uses:** `get_sdg_goal_data()` with trend analysis

### Individual District Queries
```
"What is Mumbai's performance on SDG Goal 4?"
"Show Delhi's SDG data"
"Chennai SDG Goal 3 performance"
```
**â†’ Uses:** `get_sdg_goal_data()` with individual analysis

### State-specific Queries
```
"Best districts in Karnataka for SDG Goal 6"
"Top performers in Tamil Nadu for SDG Goal 2"
```
**â†’ Uses:** State filtering in `get_sdg_goal_data()`

## ðŸŽ¨ Response Structure

Similar to your health chatbot, responses include:
```json
{
  "response": "AI-generated analysis",
  "map_type": "sdg_analysis", 
  "function_calls": [...],
  "data": [...],
  "boundary": [...]  // Spatial data for mapping
}
```

## ðŸ”„ Architecture Pattern

**Follows the same pattern as your health chatbot:**

1. **User Query** â†’ FastAPI endpoint
2. **Intent Analysis** â†’ Determine query type and parameters
3. **OpenAI Function Calling** â†’ Intelligent function selection
4. **Database Query** â†’ Execute through utils functions
5. **Response Formatting** â†’ Clean, structured output
6. **Conversation Management** â†’ Update history for context

## ðŸ“Š Database Schema Support

Works with your existing schema:
- **SDG_Goals** (33 indicators across 9 SDG goals)
- **District_State** (district-state mapping)
- **Aspirational_Status** (aspirational district classification)
- **SDG_Status** (SDG achievement status)
- **SDG_Goals_Data** (main data with NFHS-4/NFHS-5 values)
- **vw_complete_sdg_data** (comprehensive view)

## ðŸš€ How to Run

### Quick Start
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure database and API key in config.py
# Or create .env file from env.example

# Start server
python run_server.py
# Or: uvicorn sdg_main:app --reload
```
